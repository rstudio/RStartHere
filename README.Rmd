# RStartHere
A guide to some of the most useful R Packages that we know about, organized by their role in data science.

[Click here to suggest packages.](https://github.com/rstudio/RStartHere/edit/master/README.Rmd)


## Data Science Workflow 
Each data science project is different, but each follows the same general steps. You:

!["The data science workflow"](data-science.png)


1. [Import](#import) your data into R
2. [Tidy](#tidy) it
3. Understand your data by iteratively 
    a. [visualizing](#visualize)
    b. [tranforming](#transform) and 
    c. [modeling](#modelinfer) your data
4. [Infer](#infer) how your understanding applies to other data sets (_including future data, i.e. predictions_)
5. [Communicate](#communicate) your results to an audience, or
6. [Automate](#automate) your analysis for easy reuse
7. [Program](#program) the whole way through, since you do each of these things on a computer

Below we list the most useful R packages that we know of for each step.

## Criteria

What makes an R Package useful? A useful R package should perform a useful task, and it should do it well. Here are some criteria that we used to make the list.

* The code in the package runs fast, with few errors.
* The code in the package has an intuitive syntax that is easy to remember.
* The package plays well with other packages; you do not need to munge your data into new forms to use the package.
* The package is widely used and recommended by its users.
* The package has a development website, or series of vignettes, that make the package easy to learn.
* The package is developed in the open (e.g. on Github or RForge).
* The package uses tests to ensure that it will be stable and bug free well into the future.
* The package is stable and available from CRAN, or we are personally involved with the package and committed to its development.

For other useful choices, please check out our list of [popular packages that did not quite meet these criteria](runners-up.md).

You can learn more about packages in R with the [CRAN task views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/).
